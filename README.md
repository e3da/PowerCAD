# PowerSynth 1 Release Series
## Overview
This is the archived repository for PowerSynth 1 (v1.0-v1.4).
The newer version of PowerSynth 2 (v1.9-v2.x) will be located in the new PowerSynth repository.

This repositoty only includes the source code portion. Other necessary data files, manuals, and packaging materials are included in the PowerCAD-Full repository. 
The source code is mainly developed with Python 2.7 on the Windows platform.

Due to the obsolete nature of the code development, it is mainly kepted for archival purpose. With latest development efforts have since shift to PowerSynth 2. 
## History
The original repository is migrated to git from the old CVS repo.
The earily development efforts are aggregated into the a few milestones commits. 
It only includes several main branches released for the public. Academic research is performed on individual branches which may or may not be included in the master branch. Contact the paper authors regarding individual development efforts. 

# PowerSynth 1 Project Overview
PowerSynth 1 is developed originally by the [MSCAD Lab](https://mscad.uark.edu/) and then joinly with the [E3DA Lab](https://e3da.csce.uark.edu/), at University of Arkansas. The PowerSynth 1 project is co-directed by [Prof. Alan Mantooth](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/mantooth/name/Alan+Mantooth/) and [Prof. Yarui Peng](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/yrpeng/name/Yarui+Peng/). 

The main developers of this release series include Quang Le, Imam Al Razi, Tristan Evans, and Shilpi Mukherjee. Earlier prototypes (prior to v1.0) are mainly developed by Brett Shook and Zihao Gong. The codebase also received contributions from many collaborators, graduates, and undergrads.

The main features, models, and algorithms of PowerSynth 1 are summarized in the following papers:
